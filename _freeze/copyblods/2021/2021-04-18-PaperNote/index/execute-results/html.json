($\\gamma>1$, $\\lambda\\approx1$, and $\\sigma>1.2$)\n\nGenerate the comprehensive score by multiplying the sparsity interval and measures at all sparsities.\n\nHub node is at least one standard deviation greater than the average of parameter (x > mean + SD).\n\nAsymmetry score (A) = 100 * (R-L)/(0.5*(R+L)), and positive asymmetry scores indicated right-ward asymmetry and vice versa.\n\n### Links\n\n1. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.066",
